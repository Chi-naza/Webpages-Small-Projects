I have known him for the past ten years as his godmother. 
He is very obedient, responsible and well trained and has never involved himself in any cult practices. 
He is intelligent and contributes meaningfully during group discussions.
He also shows the required commitment to accomplish any responsibility he is given.

 <p class="aza">
He has continued to enjoy very sound health and I wish to strongly recommend him for any assistance required. 
Thanks for your time and understanding.
